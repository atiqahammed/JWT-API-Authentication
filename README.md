# JWT-API-Authentication-
In this project I am going to create a node.js api that is going to handle Authentication component for any application I want to use it in.  I am going to cover an authentication method using jwt. I will use mongodb as our database, mongoose to create models and to connect to our express server, bcryptjs to hash passwords and jwt to check for private routes.
